# Part III: Ponzi

## Chapter 40

"You should go to Hong Kong," Lu said to Jie, holding her hand tightly and staring into her eyes. "You can do the show from there. It's safer."

Jie turned her head and blew out a stream of air. She squeezed his hand. "I know that you mean the best, Tank, but I won't do it and I want you to stop talking about it. I'm a Webbly, just like you, just like everyone here. Sure, I can broadcast from Hong Kong, *technically*, but what would I broadcast *about*? I'm a journalist, Tank. I need to be here to see what's going on, to report on it. I can't do that from HK."

"But it's not safe --"

She cut him off with a chopping gesture. "Of course it's not safe! I haven't been interested in safety since the day I went on the air. You're not safe. My factory girls aren't safe. The Webblies on the picket lines aren't safe. Why should I be safe?"

Lu bit down on the words: *because I love you*. Secretly, he was relieved. He didn't know what he'd do if Jie was in Hong Kong and he was in Shenzhen. The last of her safe-houses, another flat in a handshake building, was crowded with Webblies, forty boys all studiously ignoring them, but he knew they were listening in. They slept in shifts here, forty at a time, while eighty more went out to work at friendly net-cafes, taking care never to send more than two or three into any one cafe lest they draw attention to themselves. Just the day before, two boys had been followed out of a cafe by a couple of anonymous hard men who methodically kicked the everloving crap out of them, right on the public street, sending one to the hospital.

"You know it's only a matter of time until this place is blown," is what Lu said. "Someone will get careless and be followed home, or one of the neighbors will start to talk about all the boys who trek in and out of the flat at all hours, and then --"

"And then we'll move to another one," she said. "I have been renting and blowing off apartments for longer than you've been killing trolls. So long as the advertising keeps on paying, I'll keep on earning, and if I keep on earning, I can keep on renting."

"How long will the advertisers pay for you to spend three hours every night telling factory girls to fight back against their bosses?"

A smile played over her lips, the secret, confident smile that always melted his heart. "Oh, Tank," she said. "The advertisers don't care what I talk about, so long as the factory girls are listening, and they are *listening*."

She patted his hands. "Now, I want you to go and find me a Webbly to interview tonight, someone who can tell me how it's all going. Any more protests?"

He shook his head. "Not the noisy kind. Too many arrests." There were over a hundred Webblies in jail, all over south China. "But you heard about Dongguan?"

She shook her head.

"The Webblies there have a new kind of demonstration. Instead of making a lot of noise and shouting slogans, they all walk very slowly around the bus-station, right in the middle of town, eating ice cream."

"Ice-cream?"

He grinned. "Ice-cream. After the jingcha started to arrest anyone who even *looked* like he was going to protest, they started posting these very public notices: 'show up at such-and-such a place and buy an ice-cream.' Dozens, then hundreds of them, eating ice-cream, grinning like maniacs, and the police were there, staring at each other like mannequins, like, *Are we going to arrest these boys for eating ice-cream?* And then someone got the bright idea of buying *two* ice-creams and giving one away to someone random passing by. It's the easiest recruitment tool you can imagine!"

She laughed so long and hard that tears ran down her face. "I love you guys," she said. "I can't *wait* to talk about this on tonight's show."

"If they get arrested for eating ice-cream, they're going to switch to getting together and *smiling* at each other. Can you imagine? *Are we going to arrest these boys for smiling?*"

Her laughter broke through the invisible wall that separated them from the lounging, off-shift Webblies, who demanded to know what was so funny. Not all of them knew about the ice-cream -- they were too busy patrolling the worlds, keeping the gold-farms from being run with replacement workers -- but everyone agreed that it was pure genius.

Soon they were downloading videos of the ice-cream eating, and then another shift of boys trickled in and wanted to be let in on the joke, and before they knew it, they were planning their own ice-cream eating festival, and the general hilarity continued until Jie and Lu slipped away to 'cast her show for the night, grabbing a couple of hysterical Webblies to interview in between the calls from the factory girls.

As Lu put his head down on his pillow and draped his arm around Jie's narrow shoulders and put his face in her thick, fragrant hair, he had a moment's peace and joy, real joy, knowing that they couldn't possibly lose.
