# Part III: Ponzi

## Chapter 60

"Mom?"

"Leonard?"

"Hi, Mom." He tried to ignore Jie who was looking at him with an expression of mingled hilarity and awe. She had an encyclopedic knowledge of gamer cafes with private rooms, and had brought them to this one in the ground floor of a youth hostel that catered to foreigners and had a room set off for karaoke and net-access.

"It's been so long since I've heard your voice, Leonard."

"I know, Mom."

"How's your trip?"

"Um, fine." He tried to remember where he told her he'd be. Portland? San Francisco?

"Oh, Leonard," she said, and he heard that she was crying. It was what, 8PM back in LA, and she was crying and alone. He felt so homesick at that moment he thought he would split in two and he felt the tears running down his own cheeks.

"I love you, Mom," he blubbered.

And they both cried for a long time, and when he risked a look at Jie, she was crying too.

"Mom," he said, choking back snot. "I have a favor to ask of you. A big favor."

"You're in trouble."

"Yes." There was no point in denying it. "I'm in trouble. And I can't explain it right now."

"You're in China, aren't you?"

He didn't know what to say. "You knew."

"I suspected. It's that gamer thing, isn't it? I did the math on when you answered my messages, when you called."

"You knew?"

"I'm not stupid, Leonard." She wasn't crying anymore. "I thought I knew, but I didn't want to say anything until you told me."

"I'm sorry, Mom."

She didn't say anything.

"Are you coming home?"

He looked at Jie. "I don't know. Eventually. I have something I have to do here, first."

"And you need my help with that."

"Mom, I need you to order a shipment from Shenzhen to Mumbai." Big Sister Nor had suggested it, and Jie had shrugged and said that it was fine with her, one place was as good as any other. "I'll give you the container number. And you have to have Mr Alford call the port authority here and tell them that I'm authorized to access it."

"No, Leonard. I'll call the embassy, I'll get you home, but this is --" He could picture her hand flapping around her head. "It's crazy, is what it is."

"Mom --"

"No."

"Mom, *listen*. This is about a lot more than just me. There are people here, friends, whose lives are at stake. You can call the embassy all you want but I won't go there. If you don't help me, I'll have to do this on my own, and I have to be honest with you, Mom, I don't think I'll be able to do it. But I can't abandon my friends."

She was crying again.

"I'm going to be at the port in --" he checked the screen of his phone -- "in three hours. I've got my passport with me, that'll get me inside, *if* you've got it squared away with the port authority. The container number is WENU432134. It's at the western port. Do you have that?"

"Leonard, I won't do it."

"WENU432134," he said, very slowly, and hung up.
