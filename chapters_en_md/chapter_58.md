# Part III: Ponzi

## Chapter 58

---

Wei-Dong didn't want to wake Jie, but he needed to sleep. He finally curled up on the floor next to the mattress, using his shoulderbag as a pillow to get his face off of the filthy carpet. At first he lay rigid in the brightly lit room, his mind swirling with all he'd seen and done, but then he must have fallen asleep and fallen hard, because the next thing he knew, he was swimming up from the depths of total oblivion as Jie shook his shoulder and called his name. He opened his eyes to slits and peered at her.

"Wha?" he managed, then realized he was talking English and said, "What?" in Chinese.

"Time to go," she said. "Big Sister Nor says we have to move."

He sat up. His mouth was full of evil-tasting salty paste, a stale residue of dumplings and sleep. Self consciously, he breathed through his nose.

"Where?"

"Hong Kong," she said. "Then..." She shrugged. "Taiwan, maybe? Somewhere we can tell the story of the dead without being arrested. That's the most important thing."

"How are we going to cross the border? I don't have a Chinese visa in my passport."

She grinned. "That part is easy. We go to my counterfeiter."

It was as good a plan as any. Wei-Dong had watched the Webblies change papers again and again. Shenzhen was full of counterfeiters. He rode the Metro apart from her again, staring at his stupid guide map and trying to look like a stupid tourist, invisible. It was easier this time around, because there was so much else going on -- factory girls talking about Jie's radio show and "the 42," policemen prowling the cars and demanding the papers of any group of three or more people, searching bags and, once, confiscating a banner painted on a bedsheet. Wei-Dong didn't see what it said, but the police took four screaming, kicking girls off the train at the next station. Shenzhen was in chaos.

They got off the train at the stock market station, and he followed Jie, leaving a hundred yards between them. But he came up against her when they got to the surface. The last time he'd been here, it had been thronged with counterfeiters and touts handing out fliers advertising their services, scrap-buyers with scales lining the sidewalks, hawkers selling fruit and ices. Now it was wall-to-wall police, a cordon formed around the entrance to the stock-market. Officers were stationed every few yards on the street, too, checking papers.

Jie picked up her phone and pretended to talk into it, but Wei-Dong could see she just didn't want to look suspicious. He got out his tourist-map and pretended to study it. Gradually, they both made their way back into the station. She joined him at a large map of the surrounding area.

"Now what?" he whispered, trying not to move his mouth.

"How were you going to get out of here?" she said.

His stomach tightened. "I hadn't really thought about it much," he said.

She hissed in frustration. "You must have had some idea. How about the way you got in?"

He hadn't told anyone the details of his transoceanic voyage. It would have felt weird to admit that he was part owner of a giant shipping company. Besides, he didn't really *feel* like it was his. It was his father's.

Two policemen passed by, grim-faced, moving quickly, an urgent, insectile buzz coming from their earpieces.

"Really?"

"If we could get into the port," he said. "I think I could get us anywhere."

She smiled, and it was the first real smile he'd seen on her face since -- since before the shooting had started.

"But I need to call my mother."
