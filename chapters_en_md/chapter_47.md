# Part III: Ponzi

## Chapter 47

"Sisters!" Jie said, throwing her head back and clenching her fists. She'd been calm enough as she sat down in the basement of the Internet cafe, a private room the owner rented out discreetly to porno freelancers who needed a network connection away from the public eye. But now it seemed as if all the sorrow and pain she had shoved down into herself when Lu was shot was pouring out.

"*SISTERS!*" she said again, and it was a howl, as horrible as the noise Lu had made, as horrible as the noise that half-dead cat had made in the street in front of Wei-Dong's house.

The cafe was in the shuttered Intercontinental hotel, in the theme-restaurant that sported a full-size pirate ship sticking out of the roof, its sails in tatters. The man behind the desk had negotiated briskly with Jie for the space, studiously ignoring Wei-Dong lurking a few steps behind her. She'd motioned him along with a jerk of her head and led him to the private room, which had once been a restaurant store-room.

Once the door clicked shut behind them, she produced a bootable USB stick and restarted the computer from it, fitted an elegant, slender earwig to her ear and passed one to Wei-Dong, which he screwed into his own ear. After some futzing with the computer she signalled to him that they were live and commenced to howl like a wounded thing.

"*Sisters! My sisters!*" she said, and tears coursed down her face. "They killed him tonight. Poor Tank, my Tank. His name, his real name was Zha Yue Lu, and I loved him and he never harmed another human being and the only thing he was guilty of was demanding decent pay, decent working conditions, vacation time, job security -- the things we all want from our jobs. The things our *bosses* take for granted.

"They raided us last night, the vicious jingcha, working for the bosses as they always have and always will. They beat down the door and the boys ran like the wind, but they caught them and they caught them and they caught them. Lu and I tried to escape through the back way and they --" She broke then, tears coursing down her face, a sob bigger than the room itself escaping her chest. The mixer-readouts on the computer screen spiked red from the burst of sound. "They shot him like a dog, shot him dead."

She sobbed again, and the sobs didn't stop coming. She beat her fists on the table, tore at her hair, screamed like she was being cut with knives, screamed until Wei-Dong was sure that someone would burst the door down expecting to find a murder in progress.

Tentatively, he uncrossed his legs and got to his feet and crossed to her and caught her beating fists in his hands. She looked at him, unseeing, and stuck her face into his chest, the hot tears soaking through his t-shirt, the cries coming and coming. She pulled away for a moment, gasped, "I'm sorry, I'll be back in a few minutes," and clicked something, and the mixer levels on the screen flatlined.

On and on she cried, and soon Wei-Dong was crying too -- crying for his father, crying for Lu, crying for all the gunshots he'd heard on the way out of the handshake buildings. They rocked and cried together like that for what seemed like an eternity, and then Jie gently disengaged herself and turned back to her computer and clicked some more.

"Sisters," she said, "for years now I've sat at this mic, talking to you about love and family and dreams and work. So many of us came here looking to get away from poverty, looking to find a decent wage for a decent day's work, and instead found ourselves beating off perverted bosses, being robbed by marketing schemes, losing our wages and being tossed out into the street when the market shifts.

"No more," she said, breathing it so low that Wei-Dong had to strain to hear it. "No more," she said, louder. "NO MORE!" she shouted and stood up and began to pace, gesturing as she did.

"No more asking permission to go to the bathroom! No more losing our pay because we get sick! No more lock-ins when the big orders come in. No more overtime without pay. No more burns on our arms and hands from working the rubber-molding machinery -- how many of you have the idiotic logo of some stupid company branded into your flesh from an accident that could have been prevented with decent safety clothes?

"No more missing eyes. No more lost fingers. No more scalps torn away from a screaming girl's head as her hair is sucked into some giant machine with the strength of an ox and the brains of an ant. NO MORE!"

"Tomorrow, no one works. No one. Sisters, it's time. If one of you refuses to work, they just fire you and the machines grind on. If you all refuse to work, *the machines stop*.

"If one factory shuts down, they send the police to open it again, soldiers with guns and clubs and gas. If *all the factories* shut down, there aren't enough police in the world to open them again."

She looked at her screen. It was going crazy. She clicked in a call. Wei-Dong heard it in his earpiece.

"Jiandi," a breathy, girly voice said. "Is this Jiandi?"

"Yes, sister, it is," she said. "Who else?" She smiled a thin smile.

"Have you heard about the other deaths, in the Cantonese quarter in Shenzhen? The boys they shot?"

Wei-Dong felt like he was falling. The girl was still speaking.

"-- 42 of them, is what we heard. There were pictures, sent from phone to phone. Google for 'the fallen 42' and you'll find them. The police said it was lies, and just now, they said that they were a criminal gang, but I recognized some of those boys from the strike before, the one you told us about --"

Wei-Dong dug out his phone and began to google, typing so quickly he mashed the keys and had to retype the query three times, a process made all the more cumbersome by the need to use proxies to get around the blocks on his phone's network connections. But then he got it, and the photos dribbled into his phone's browser as slow as glaciers, and soon he was looking at shot after shot of fallen boys, lying in the narrow lanes, arms thrown out or held up around their faces, legs limp. The cam-phone photos were a little out of focus, and the phone's small screen made them even less distinct, but the sight still hit him like a hammerblow.

The girl was still speaking. "We've all seen them and the girls in my dorm are scared, and now you're telling us to walk out of our jobs. How do you know we won't be shot too?"

Jie's mouth was opening and closing like a fish. She held her hand out and snapped her fingers at Wei-Dong, who passed her his phone. Her face was terrible, her lips pulled away from her teeth, which clicked rhythmically as she looked at the photos.

"Oh," she said, as if she hadn't heard the girl's question. "Oh," she said, as if she'd just realized some deep truth that had evaded her all her life.

"Jiandi?" the girl said.

"You might be shot," Jie said, slowly, as if explaining something to a child. "I might be shot. But they can't shoot us all."

She paused, considering. Tears rolled off her chin, stained the collar of her shirt.

"Can they?"

She clicked something and a commercial started.

"I can't finish this," she said in a dead voice. "I can't finish this at all. I should go home."

Wei-Dong looked down at his hands. "I don't think that would be safe."

She shook her head. "*Home*," she said. "The village. Go back. There's a little money left. I could go home and my parents could find some boy for me to marry and I could be just another girl in the village, growing old. Have my one baby and pray it's a boy. Swallow pesticide when it gets to be too much." She looked into his eyes and he had to steel himself to keep from flinching away. "Do you know that China is the only country where more women commit suicide than men?"

Wei-Dong spoke, his voice trembling. "I can't pretend that I know what your life is like, Jie, but I can't believe that you want to do that. There are 42 dead. I don't think we can stop here." Thinking *I am so far from home and don't know how I'll get back.* Thinking, *If she goes, I'll be all alone.* And then thinking, *Coward* and wanting to hit his head against something until the thoughts stopped.

She reached for the keyboard and he knew enough about her work environment to see that she was getting ready to shut down.

"Wait!" he said. "Come on, stop." He fished for the words. In the weeks since he'd arrived in China, he'd begun to think in Chinese, even dream in it sometimes, but now it failed him. "I --" He beat his fists on his thighs in frustration. "It won't stop now," he said. "If you go home to the village, it will keep going, but it won't have you. It won't have Jiandi, the big sister to all the factory girls. When Lu told me about you, I thought he was crazy, thought there was no way you could possibly have that many listeners. He thought you were some kind of god, or a queen, a leader of an army of millions. He told me he thought you didn't understand how important you are. How you --" He paused, gathered the words. "You're shiny. That's what he said. You shine, you're like this bright, shiny thing that people just want to chase after, to follow. Everyone who meets you, everyone who hears you, they trust you, they want you to be their friend.

"If you go, the Webblies will still fight, but without you, I think they'll lose."

She glared at him. "They'll probably lose with me, too. Do you have any idea what a terrible burden you put on me? You *all* put on me? It's absolutely unfair. I'm not your god, I'm not your queen. I'm a broadcaster!"

The heat rose in Wei-Dong. "That's right! You're a broadcaster. You don't work for some government channel like CCTV, though, do you? You're underground, criminal. You spent years telling factory girls to stand up for their rights, years living in safe-houses and carrying fake IDs. You set yourself up to be where you are now. I can't believe that you didn't dream about this. Look me in the eye and tell me that you didn't *dream* about being a leader of millions, about having them all follow you and look up to you! Tell me!"

She did something absolutely unexpected. She laughed. A little laugh, a broken laugh, a laugh with jagged shards of glass in it, but it was a laugh anyway. "Yes," she said. "Yes, of course. With a hairbrush for a microphone, in front of my parents' mirror, pretending to be the DJ that they all listened to. Of course. What else?"

Her smile was so sad and radiant it made Wei-Dong weak in the knees. "I never thought I'd end up here, though. I thought I'd be a pretty girl on television, recognized in the street. Not a fugitive."

Wei-Dong shrugged, back on familiar territory. "The future's a weirder place than we thought it would be when we were little kids. Look at gold-farming, how weird is that?"

She grinned. "No weirder than making rubber bananas for Swedish department-store displays. That was my first job when I came here, you know?" She rolled up her sleeves and showed him her arms. They were crisscrossed with old burn-scars. "Then making cheap beads for something called 'Mardi Gras.' Boss Chan liked me, liked how I worked with the hot plastic. No complaining, even though we didn't have masks, even though I was burned over and over again." She twisted her forearm and he saw that she had the Nike logo branded backwards, in bubbled, wrinkled scar there. "Afterwards, I worked on the same kind of machine, in a shoe factory. You see the logo? Many of us have it. It's like we were cattle, and the factory branded us one at a time."

"Are you going to talk to the people again?"

She slumped. Slipped in her earwig. Began to prod at the computer. "Yes," she said. "Yes, I must. As long as they'll listen, I must."
