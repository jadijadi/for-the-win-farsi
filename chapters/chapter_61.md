# Part III: Ponzi

## Chapter 61

There were five of them in all.  Matthew, Jie, Wing, Shirong, and Wei-Dong. They'd stopped at a 7-11 on the way to the train station and bought as much food as they could carry, asking the bemused clerk to pack it in boxes and seal them with packing tape.

As they approached the port, they stopped talking, walking slowly and deliberately. Wei-Dong steeled himself and walked to the guard's booth. He hadn't called his mother back. There hadn't been time. Shenzhen was in chaos, police-checks and demonstrations everywhere, some riots, spirals of black smoke heading into the sky.

He motioned for Wing to join him. They had agreed that he would play interpreter, to make Wei-Dong seem like more of a hopeless gweilo, above suspicion. They'd found him some cheap fake Chinese Nike gear to wear, a ridiculous track suit that reminded him of the Russian gangsters he'd see around Santee Alley.

Wordlessly, he handed his passport -- his real passport, held safely all this time -- to the young man on the gate. "WENU432134," he said. "Rosenbaum Logistics container."

He waited for Wing to translate, watched him sketch out the English letters on his palm.

The security guard looked over his shoulder at the two policemen in the booth with him. He picked up a scratched tablet and prodded at it with a blunt finger, squinting at Wei-Dong's passport. Wei-Dong hoped that he wouldn't try something clever, like riffling its pages looking for a Chinese visa.

He began to shake his head, said "I don't see it --"

Wei-Dong felt sweat run down his butt-crack and over his thighs. He craned his neck to see the screen. There it was, but the number had been entered wrong, WENU432144. He pointed to it and said, "Tell him that this is the one." He sent a silent thanks to his mother. The guard compared the number to the one he'd entered and then seemed about to let them pass. Then one of the policeman said, "Wait."

The cop shouldered the security guard out of the way, took the passport from him, examined it closely, holding a page up to the light to see the watermark. "What are you bringing?"

Wei-Dong waited for Wing to translate.

"Samples," he said. "Clothes."

He opened up the box at his feet and pulled out a folded tee-shirt emblazoned with some Chinese characters that said "I'm stupid enough to think that this shirt looks cool." Jie had found them from one of the few stubborn peddlers left on the street outside of the Metro entrance near the train station. The cop snorted and said, "Does he know what this says?"

Wing nodded. "Yes," he said. "But he thinks that other Americans won't. If they like it, they will  order twenty thousand from us!" He laughed, and after a moment, the cop and the security guard joined in. The cop slapped Wei-Dong on the shoulder and Wei-Dong forced a laugh out as well.

"OK," the cop said, handing back his papers. The security guard gave them directions. "But you'll have to use the north gate to leave. We're closing this one for the evening in half an hour."

Wing made a show of translating for Wei-Dong, who had the presence of mind to pretend to listen, but he was rocking on his heels, almost at the point of collapse from lack of sleep and food.

They walked in total silence to the container, and Wei-Dong managed to only look over his shoulder once. Jie caught his eye when he did and waggled a finger at him. He smiled wryly and looked ahead, following the directions.

The container was just as he'd left it, and his key fit the padlock. The four marvelled at the cleverness of his work inside as they efficiently unpacked their food.

"Three nights, huh?" said Jie, as he pulled the door shut behind them.

"After they load us."

"When will that be?"

He sighed. "I need to call my mother to find out." He pulled out his phone and Jie handed him her last SIM and a calling card.
