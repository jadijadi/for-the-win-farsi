# Part III: Ponzi

## Chapter 46

"A strike," General Robotwallah announced to her troops. "No more gold gets in or out of any of our games."

"Forty two dead," Yasmin said, in a voice leaden with sorrow.

*Forty three*, Ashok thought, remembering the boy, and sure enough, Yasmin mouthed *Forty three* as she sat down.

"We'll need defense here," General Robotwallah said. "Bannerjee will find more badmashes to try to take us out of this place."

Sushant stood up and held up a machete that the boys had left behind. "We took this place. We'll hold it," he said, all teen bravado. Ashok felt like he would be sick.

Yasmin and the General looked intensely at one another, a silent conversation taking place.

"No more violence," the General said, in the voice of command.

Sushant deflated, looked humiliated. "But what if they come for us with knives and clubs and guns?" he said, defiant.

Yasmin stood up and walked to stand next to her general. "We make sure they don't," she said.

Ashok stood and went to his little back room and began to place phone calls.
